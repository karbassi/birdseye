TODO.TXT Bird's Eye View Reporter

USAGE:
    birdseye.py [todo.txt] [done.txt]

USAGE NOTES:
    Expects two text files as parameters, each of which formatted as follows:
    - One todo per line, ie, "call Mom"
    - with an optional project association indicated as such: "+projectname"
    - with the context in which the tasks should be completed, indicated as such: "@context"
    - with the task priority optionally listed at the front of the line, in parens, ie, "(A)"

    For example, 4 lines of todo.txt might look like this:

    +garagesale @phone schedule Goodwill pickup
    (A) @phone Tell Mom I love her
    +writing draft Great American Novel
    (B) smell the roses

    The done.txt file is a list of completed todos from todo.txt.

    Displays a list of:
    - working projects and their percentage complete
    - contexts in which open todos exist
    - contexts and projects with tasks that have been prioritized
    - projects which are completely done (don't have any open todos)
